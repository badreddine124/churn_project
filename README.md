Telecom Churn prediction using machine Learning


**Plan:**
  1. Preprocessing task:   

    a. Summary and basic information of the data   

    b. Replace null values and perform exploratory data analysis   

    c. Transform skewed variables, categorical and binary features   

  2. Selection features: use three methods for feature selection:   

    a. Remove collinear features   

    b. Remove features with greater than a threshold percentage of missing values    

    c. Keep only the most relevant features using feature importance from a model    
    
  3. Make prediction using machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest et XGboost
